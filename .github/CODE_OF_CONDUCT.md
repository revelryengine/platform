# Revelry Engine Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, and collaborative environment for anyone who wishes to contribute to the Revelry Engine project. It applies to all community interactions including GitHub discussions, issues, pull requests, and any other communication channels.

- **Be respectful of questions and contributors at all levels.** Questions at any level are encouraged. We come from all walks of life with varying levels of experience. Revelry Engine is meant to be accessible to everyone, from first-time contributors to seasoned professionals.

- **Be respectful of each other's time and circumstances.** Game development is not everyone's day job and we may not all have the same freedom to contribute. This should never preclude hobbyists or professional developers from participating meaningfully in our community.

- **Assume good intentions and communicate constructively.** When interpreting the words and actions of others, always assume positive intent. Focus on the idea, not the person, and provide feedback that helps move the project forward.

- **Embrace healthy debate and opposing viewpoints.** Different perspectives strengthen our project. Be open to opposing views and give them careful consideration. This helps crystallize our own viewpoints and allows us to reach better consensus through thoughtful discussion.

- **Create an inclusive and harassment-free environment.** Behavior that can reasonably be considered harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks will not be tolerated. We are committed to providing a welcoming space for all contributors.
