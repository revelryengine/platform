## About Revelry Engine

Welcome to Revelry Engine, a game engine designed with the belief that the Web is the ultimate platform for game development. We are committed to making game creation free and accessible for everyone, regardless of their background or experience.

### Our Philosophy

We believe in the power of the Web as a platform. The Web is universal, open, and accessible, making it the perfect platform for game development. With Revelry Engine, you can create games that can be played on any device with a web browser, reaching a global audience.

#### Web Standards First

All features of the engine are backed by web standards and as such, should be browser/platform agnostic. In practice this means that if the engine doesn't run in a specific browser, it is because that browser has not yet implemented a specific web standard.

#### Designed to be Build-Less

We believe that reducing the number of hurdles to get started in game development can go a long way in keeping learning developers interested. Because of this, Revelry Engine is designed to work without a build step. By not requiring a build step, we can ensure that developers spend less time configuring an environment and more time making games. This also ensure the engine code can be inspecting in it's original form during runtime which fosters a better understanding of the engine code and leads to a more engaged community.

It is written as a javascript framework using standard ES Modules, but we do believe in the value of type safety so you will find JSDoc style type comments and supplementary `.d.ts` files to provide this without requiring any build step.

The engine provides a streamlined process for including a minimal initial download on first render. Because of the nature of video games in general, the bulk of the file size will be game assets such as textures or 3d models and not source code, therefore bundling the source code will not provide as much impact on load time compared to a typical web application.

This does not preclude developers from ultimately bundling their games in production if they so choose.


### Our Commitment to Accessibility

We believe that making games should be free and accessible for everyone. That's why Revelry Engine is free to use. We want to lower the barriers to entry for game development, allowing anyone with a passion for games to create their own.


### Open Source and MIT License

Revelry Engine is proud to be an open-source project. We believe in the power of community and collaboration, and we want to give back to the game development community by making our code available to everyone.

Our project is licensed under the MIT License, one of the most permissive and widely used open-source licenses. This license allows you to use, modify, and distribute the code freely, as long as the original copyright and license notice are included. This means you can use Revelry Engine for any purpose, even in commercial projects, without any restrictions.

The MIT License also protects contributors from being held liable for any damages that arise from the use of their contributions. This encourages more developers to contribute to the project, leading to a more robust and innovative game engine.

By choosing the MIT License, we hope to foster a vibrant and inclusive community around Revelry Engine, where everyone is free to learn, create, and share.

### Ownership of Games Created with Revelry Engine

While the Revelry Engine libraries and code are covered under the MIT License, it's important to note that any games that developers create using our engine are solely owned by them. The games you create are your intellectual property, and they are not subject to the same licensing restrictions as the engine itself. You are free to license and distribute your games under any terms you choose. Revelry Engine is just a tool to help you bring your game ideas to life.
